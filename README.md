# Game-Engines-Assignment-1

Game Description
My game is a 2D side scroller. The core gameplay is to reach the end of the level by dodging obstacles using inversions in gravity.  
To scope it for this assignment I chose to have limited detail on design, to polish and create engaging gameplay.

Object Inventory
•	Scripts 
	o	One used for player movement
	o	One used for respawning the player after failure

•	Models
	o	Low poly models for the base prototype, not extreme detail
	o	Environment is also less detailed for base prototype

•	Textures
	o	Base materials for base prototype. I’m using base materials to get the general idea across.
